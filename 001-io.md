## 3 channels for I/O:
1. STDIN
2. STDOUT
3. STDERR

### Redirection:
>, >>, <, << all direct output somewhere.
>& - redirect STDOUT and STDERR to same place
2> - Redrect STDERR only

**Example:**

	$ find / -name core 2> /dev/null #Will now output error, discards error

Get only "real" matches (Matches the user has permission to read):

	$ find / -name core > /tmp/corefiles 2> /dev/null # Output to /tmp/corefiles

### Pipes
Connect STDOUT of one command to STDIN of another, use pipes

	$ ps -ef | grep httpd #List processes and find lines with 'httpd'	$ cut -d: -f7 < /etc/passwd | sort -u #Grab unique values output from /etc/passwd and sort. Print to terminal
	
### Chain commands
Run command if first success [Exit(0)]
	
	$ cd /tmp && rm /tmp/somethin
	
Run command only if first fails:

	$ cd /tmp || some_something_else

Use Backslash to add commands to next line (Cleaner)

	$ cp --preserve --r /etc/* /spare/backup \
		echo "Did not back up"

### Variables
	$ something='something' #no spaces!
	$ echo $something #use $ when referencing
	$ numb='8';
	$ echo "This is the ${numb}th time!" #curly bracets, works around "", but not ''
Use "export" to promote a shell variable to an environment one. Write these to ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile to get them at startup

Backticks can let you run commands inside of a string:
	
	$ echo "There are `wc -l /etc/passwd` lines in the passwd file."
	
### Filter commands
Use with <,>,| ftw

`cut:` prints selected portions of input lines. Tab deliminated but can be changed with -d. -f option specifies which fields to output

`sort:` Sorts lines of input

	-b Ignore leading whitespace	-f Case insensitive sorting	-k Specify the columns that form the sort key	-n Compare fields as integer numbers	-r Reverse sort order	-t Set field separator (the default is whitespace)	-u Output unique records only 
	$ sort -t: -k3,3 -n /etc/group # sort numerically (-n). Sort on 3rd column (-k3,3)
`uniq` - Print unique lines with some stats
	$ cut -d: -f7 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -c #
`wc` (-l, -w, -c) Count lines, words, characters
	$ wc /etc/passwd # result: 32 77 2003 /etc/passwd
`tee` - copy input to two places, usually to a file AND to terminal window
	$ find / -name core | tee /dev/tty | wc -l #/dev/tty is current terminal
`head`, `tail` (-f) - Head does the head of the file. Tail does the end. -f is awesome.
`grep` - Search text
	c Print count of matching lines	i Ignore case when matching
	v Show non-matching
	l Only show file names with matches
	
	$ sudo grep -l mdadm /var/log/* # Look for 'mgdadm' in all log files, output file names
